# Valatore's Ascension Addons

This repo is a place for me to host any addons I make for Ascension WoW. Please feel free to browse and leave comments or feedback on anything, and if I think it's an improvement, I'll try out your suggestion! If you want to collaborate with me, feel free to fork a directory and submit a pull request. When making a pull request, please know that I won't be fixing merge conflicts for you, and I will only consider your pull request once reviewing and approving your code. If I make comments or tasks on your pull request, it means I am genuinely interested and would like to see some changes before I consider merging it to the official addons. Thank you!

## [LevelUpDetails](/LevelUpDetails/)

LevelUpDetails is an addon I wrote very quickly to get a basic understanding of the Lua language. It waits for you to level up, and then prints messages in the chat to tell you what stats you gained from leveling up.
